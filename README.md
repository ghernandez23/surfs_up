## Project Overview

I have been tasked with determining weather patterns in Oahu, Hawaii in the months of June and December. My employer Avy is looking into opening up a surf shop and would like to know what type of weather to prepare for in the area!

## Results 

-In the month of June, the average daily temp is just under 75 at 74.94. 
-The absolute hottest temp recorded is 85 and the lowest temp is 64. 
-In the month of December, we can see that the average daily temp is 71.04
-the hottest temp recorded being 83 and the lowest being 56.

## Summary 

After a thorough review of the weather in both June and December we can conclude that overall, the weather is pretty consistent year round in Oahu Hawaii. The daily temp between the months of June and December only vary by 4 degrees. The high temp between the two months only varies by 1 degree with the biggest change coming from the highest temp recorded in each month with a 9 degree difference.
